This is a pipelined mips architecture cpu.
It uses reduced commands, {lw, sw, add, sub, beq, j}
Using a 'word_size' variable the code will try to work for either 16(word_size=2) or 32(word_size=4) bit.

OK, I played the music and figured out why this cannot happen,
You cannot have 32 and 16 (or 64etc) bits switch with a single variable, 
however you can generalize lots of components to handle different sizes of input

So after building all the components using generics and methods that don't limit your program,
you can build a set of 16 and 32 bit specific components
and when connecting the components select the ones you need.

That's how it could be done.
That's it for now
